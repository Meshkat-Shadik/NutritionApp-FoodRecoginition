## Some FAQ

- Purpose?

Well, I feel flutter is an art. Then again, I want to made an app for suggesting nutrition app, which can take a fruit/vegetables image and showing it's nutritions.

- What the hell is this section (NutritionApp-FoodRecoginition) doing?

It just detect a fruit/vegetable from realtime image captured by camera/gallery

- From where the nutrition will come?

Hehe, boi, A tricky api I've implemented from another API. Check that git's readme file https://github.com/Meshkat-Shadik/NutritionAppBackend

- Any source for how to train dataset?

I can share my kaggle notebook. Here is the link https://www.kaggle.com/shadikfaysal/fruit-and-vegetables-ssm/notebook

And also the dataset.

## Again

This is served on **_Heroku_**, it is too slow to perform. I think it can be use for a testing app, not for a production level app.

## What's next then?

- Need to push this backend without heroku. Because, heroku server requires a lot of time üòè
