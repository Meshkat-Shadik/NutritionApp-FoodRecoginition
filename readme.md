## Warning

_Update : 14 October, 2021_

> This API is under developing, As my **_Keras Model_** trained with few datasets, it may return unwanted result. 😬😬

I'll update this API from **_/test/_** mode to **_/v1/_** when it is ready.

## Some FAQ

- Purpose?

Well, I feel flutter is an art. Then again, I want to make an app for suggesting nutrition values, which can take a fruit/vegetables image and showing it's nutritions.

- What the hell is this section (NutritionApp-FoodRecoginition) doing?

It just detect a fruit/vegetable from realtime image captured by camera/gallery

- From where the nutrition will come?

Hehe, boi, A tricky api I've implemented from another API. Check that git's readme file https://github.com/Meshkat-Shadik/NutritionAppBackend

- Any source for how to train dataset?

I can share my kaggle notebook. Here is the link https://www.kaggle.com/shadikfaysal/fruit-and-vegetables/notebook

## Again

This is served on **_Heroku_**, it is too slow to perform. I think it can be use for a testing app, not for a production level app.

## What's next then?

- I've to train the model with new dataset in kaggle/jupyter nootbook to give accurate result as much it can!

- Need to push this backend without heroku. Because, heroku server requires a lot of time 😏
